      * 1  CREATES AN INDEXED EQUIVALENT OF THE STUDENT MASTER FILE
      *    (STUDENT-NUMBER IS THE KEY FIELD).
      * 2  CREATES AN INDEXED EQUIVALENT OF THE GRADE FILE
      *    (STUDENT-NUMBER + RECORD COUNT FOR PRIMARY KEY AND
      *    STUDENT-NUMBER AS THE SECONDARY KEY).
      * 3  DISPLAY AN ANNOUNCEMENT SCREEN.
      * 4  QUERY THE USER FOR THE DESIRED STUDENT NUMBER.
      * 5  READ THE STUDENT MASTER FROM DISK.
      *    A  IF NO MASTER FOR THE REQUEST, DISPLAY AN ERROR MESSAGE.
      *    B  DISPLAY STUDENT MASTER DATA; CALCULATE GRADE POINT
      *       AVERAGE = EARNED GRADE POINTS/TOTAL UNITS.
      * 6  READ EACH COURSE RECORD FOR THIS STUDENT.
      * 7  IF THE REQUESTED STUDENT HAS NO COURSE RECORDS, DISPLAY AN
      *    APPROPRIATE ERROR MESSAGE.
